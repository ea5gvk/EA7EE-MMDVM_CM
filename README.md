# Description

This is the source code of several tools for cross-mode conversion for some digital voice protocols, based on Jonathan G4KLX's [MMDVM](https://github.com/g4klx) software.

In this fork I will only work on the YSF2DMR branch.
I will try to enhance the code to include new functionalities:

- Voice Beacon
- AMBE recording
- AMBE dinamic compression to avoid voice distortion on Yaesu equipment
- Auto conect to dinamic TG at start
- Auto back to inital default TG on timeout
- Bypass Brandmeister APRS functionality
- Bypass Brandmeister two second Banning
- Define Icon and mesage of Node send to ARPS-IS
- Use GM button from Yaesu Equipment to put beacon directly to APRS-IS
- Display number of nodes conected to TG on Wires-X connect
- Store WiresX SMS and Photo on Node for later retrieval 
- Send WiresX SMS to email and Telegram and back
- Send WiresX Photo to email and Telegram and back
